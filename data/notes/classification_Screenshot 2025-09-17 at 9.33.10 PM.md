**Type:** note
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The text is a structured list of grammar rules and common errors for SAT Writing preparation, with chapter references (e.g., 'ch. 4', 'ch. 9'). It contains educational content like explanations ('comma splice * WRONG'), corrections ('its, their = possessive'), and study tips ('Reread the paragraph...'), but lacks a specific practice question, incorrect answer attempt, or step-by-step error analysis required for 'wrong question' classification. The 'WRONG' markers indicate general pitfalls, not a resolved test question.
