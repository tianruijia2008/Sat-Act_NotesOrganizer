## Summary
The provided content is a fragmented SAT Writing study note (Chapter 4) focused on grammar rules, particularly highlighting comma splice errors. It includes a reference to a wrong question where 'shorter is better' was misapplied, causing a comma splice mistake. The note also mentions related concepts like comma usage with pronouns and unclear references to other rules (e.g., comma + apostrophe).

## Content Relationships
The note (index 0) directly explains the comma splice error referenced in the wrong question (index 0), citing Chapter 4 and the 'shorter is better' misconception. The note's first point (comma + pronouns) provides specific context for the wrong question's error pattern. The wrong question serves as a practical example of the rule violation described in the note, creating a cause-effect relationship where the note's guidance prevents the mistake.

## Wrong Questions
### Question 1
A SAT Writing question where a comma splice was incorrectly chosen (e.g., 'It was raining, we stayed inside') under the misconception that 'shorter is better' improves conciseness.
**Related Notes:** Note 1
**Mistake Explanation:** The student misapplied the 'shorter is better' guideline by using a comma splice (joining two independent clauses with only a comma), which violates standard grammar rules. This error often occurs when replacing a period/conjunction with a comma for brevity.
**Correct Approach:** Identify if both clauses are independent (can stand as separate sentences). If yes, correct the comma splice by: (1) using a period, (2) adding a conjunction (e.g., 'and', 'but'), or (3) using a semicolon. Never sacrifice grammatical correctness for brevity.
