**Type:** note
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The text explains the design philosophy of SAT Reading questions, contrasting them with school English classes and emphasizing the test's requirement for unambiguous answers. It provides general educational advice about test-taking strategy without presenting a specific practice problem, incorrect answer, or step-by-step correction. This aligns with 'note' characteristics (conceptual explanation/study material) rather than 'wrong question' (which requires a concrete example of an answered problem with error analysis).

SAT Reading is Designed to Trick You. You Need to Learn How

Here's why: the SAT is a weird test. When you take it, don't you get the sense that the questions
are nothing like what you've seen in school?

| bet you've had this problem: in SAT Reading passages, you often miss questions because of an
‘unlucky guess." You'll try to eliminate a few answer choices, and the remaining answer choices will
all sound equally good to you.

Well, you throw up your hands and randomly guess.

This was one of the major issues for myself when | was studying SAT Reading, and | know it affects
thousands of my students at PrepScholar.

The SAT is purposely designed this way to confuse you. Literally millions of other students have
the exact same problem you do. And the SAT knows this.

Normally in your school's English class, the teacher tells you that all interpretations of the text are
valid. You can write an essay about anything you want, and English teachers aren't (usually)
allowed to tell you that your opinion is wrong. This is because they can get in trouble for telling you
what to think, especially for complex issues like slavery or poverty.

But the SAT has an entirely different problem. It's a national test, which means it needs a level
playing field for all students around the country. It needs a solid test to compare students with
each other. Every question needs a single, unambiguously, 100% correct answer.
